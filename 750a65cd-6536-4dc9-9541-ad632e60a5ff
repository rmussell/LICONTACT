We have 4 Bugs

1. The name being parsed from the JSON structure isn't alwasy the correct profile name - FIXED (now getting from profile picture title/alt)
2. Company name isn't being collected - FIXED (added multiple selectors to find company name)
3. Sometimes the name grabbed is persisted to the next grab and it fetches the wrong name
4. Phone field sometimes captures dates instead of phone numbers - FIXED (added validation to only store actual phone numbers)


We have 1 feature request

1. Capture the linkedin profile URL and push it to HubSpot - FIXED (now using hs_linkedin_url property)

Future Enhancement Ideas:
1. Add profile picture to HubSpot (requires file upload implementation)
